def get_result(querry, user_id):
    return "Hey " + user_id
'''
get the user id then we can use it from the python insterface so as to get the information from the google server by querrying with the id
a possible problem is that our python app wont be able queey directly -
    -- either register python app and chang the whole login thing into python
    -- or pipe python querry through the html server ;)
